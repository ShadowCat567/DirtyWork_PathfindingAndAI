# PathfindingAndAI
Pathfinding and Behavioral AI that I worked on for my Game Design Capstone Project, Dirty Work. I should note, there are a lot more systems that rely on the Pathfinding and Behavior AI that I have been working on for this project, but much of that work does not enhance the Pathfinding and Behavior work shown here as it is primarily related to either enemy spawning or systems that I was not the main contributor for. 

Essentially, this only scratches the surface of what is going on in Dirty Work, but the rest will stay in a private repository since it is work either I or my teammates would prefer to keep private.
